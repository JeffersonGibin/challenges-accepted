## Challenge: Weather forecast SPA

***Stack**: React*<br/>

Let's take a look at the weather forecast? The goal is to create a SPA (Single Page Application) to consume [Yahoo's weather forecast API](https://developer.yahoo.com/weather/). Layout should be responsive and as close as possible to the images below:

Web:

![Layout web 01](layout-web-01.png)

![Layout web 02](layout-web-02.png)

Mobile:

## Tips

* Alright, you can use jQuery. If you prefer not to use (bonus!), you can use Axios to communicate with the API.
* HTML should be as semantic as possible.
* Readme and deployment instructions are welcomed.
* CSS preprocessors like Stylus or LESS are welcomed too.
* What about using BEM methodology? http://getbem.com/naming/
